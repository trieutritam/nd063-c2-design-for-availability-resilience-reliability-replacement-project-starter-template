* For a single AZ outage
- Minimum RTO
The RTO is the time it takes to make the standby instance become primary. So the RTO around 2-5 minutes.
- Minimum RPO
Data is persisted to standby instance on write, so the RPO is 0 minute.

* For a single region outage
- Minimum RTO
The RTO will be the time to promote the replica. This is around 5 minutes.
- Minimum RPO
Data is asynchronous to region, so the RPO is around 10 minutes
